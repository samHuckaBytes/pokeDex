# pokeDex
This app makes an api request from pokeapi.co to retrieve data for any pokemon the user chooses. This is my first JavaScript project I've done outside of the coding bootcamp. My goal was to write a script that can pull json data from an api and to use methods inherint to arrays such as the .map() method. I chose pokemon simply because pokeapi.co is FREE to use and the json looked extremely challenging, but in the end it was worth it because I had a ton of fun writing this code! 
I had my long time friend and coding mentor, Waseem Alame, help me with this app. Without him I never would have bought my computer and began this adventure. Whenever I got stuck he took the time to help me out, and instead of just giving me the answers he was able to craft his questions in such a way that I was guided to the correct solutions.
